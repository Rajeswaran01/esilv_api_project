The project is a web application designed to extract articles from OpenAI's blog, analyze the sentiment of their titles, and make these functionalities available via a REST API developed with Flask. The main goal is to provide an automated way to retrieve the latest articles and evaluate their sentimental tone, which can be useful for trend analyzes or content aggregations. The code is organized into three main files: , which handles scraping articles using  and  to parse the HTML; , which uses NLTK and its  to calculate headline sentiment scores; and , which serves as an entry point for the Flask application, defining API routes and orchestrating interactions between scraping and sentiment analysis. This modular structure facilitates maintenance and evolution of the code, each file being dedicated to a specific functionality of the application.
